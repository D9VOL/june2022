<p>
    <b>The Simpsons</b> is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The
    series is
    a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart,
    Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture and society,
    television, and the human condition. The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series
    of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks. He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after
    his own family members, substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded
    similar to "simpleton". The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After three
    seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top
    30 ratings in a season (1989–1990).

    <b>Homer Jay Simpson</b> (born May 12, 1956)[36] is the main protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show). He is the

    Bartholomew <b>"Bart" Jojo Simpson</b> (born April 1[7] or February 23[8]) is the mischievous, rebellious,
    misunderstood,
    disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is the only son of
    Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after
    discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit",
    "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson
    Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.

<h2><a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Simpson">Lisa Simpson</a></h2>
<p>
    <b>Lisa Marie Simpson</b> (born May 9)[9] is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the two
    tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.
    In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called Lil'
    Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement of
    the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family.
    In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing
    saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity
    is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. She focuses on
    her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a member of Mensa with an IQ
    of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out to those who she deems lower than her or even
    above her. She has extreme jealously from time to time and will do whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the
    smartest; but only if she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the intelligent one who usually thinks things
    through.
